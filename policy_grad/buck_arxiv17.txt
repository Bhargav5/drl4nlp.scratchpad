Goal & Challenges:
* Question answering system
* Issuing the right query

Novelty/Contributions:
* Agent that learns to optimally probe the system with natural language reformulations of initial question and aggregate the evidence to return best possible answer
* Evaluate on SearchQA
* Reformulator - Seq2Seq
* Aggregator - CNN - Evaluate the candidate answers returned by environment and select the one to return

RL:
* Agent - Learn to communicate optimally to maximize the probability of receiving the correct answer.
* Reward - Answer quality - F1 score
* Environment - BiDirectional Attention Flow QA system
* Policy Gradients - REINFORCE
* Environment is opaque to agent
* Entropy regularization on policy

Pros/Cons:
* Improves F1 by 11% over baselines

Future directions:
* AQA is a general framework for stateful, iterative, and interactive information seeking tasks.
* Environment can have multiple information sources: e.g. a QA system, a search engine
* Decision making process can take the form of a critic or Q-function
* Value function can be stateful
