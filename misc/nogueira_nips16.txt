Goal & Challenges:
* Propose a benchmark task to evaluate an agent with abilities to understand natural language and plan on partially observed environments
* High-level reasoning based on natural languages
* Efficient sequential decision-making capability
* Action space is huge; Large vocabulary;

Novelty/Contributions:
* WebNav that automatically transforms a website into goal-driven web navigation task; 
* web page = nodes; hyperlinks = directed edges; agent has to find piece of text taken from a random web page; navigate and find target node;
* Control parameters = max_hops from start_node, length of query
* Evaluate with jeopardy questions
* Evaluate against Simple Search, Lucene and Google Search

RL: 
* A designated start node
* Many target nodes for a query
* Partially observed - graph structure is not known to the agent
* Action - union of all outgoing edges + stop <= state-dependent action sapce
* Reward - 1 if query is contained in the current node
Agent:
* Function - RNN, Feed-Forward
* Content - BOW
* Query - BOW, attention
* Inference - Beam search

Pros/Cons:
* Proposed task reflects the advances in models, making it a suitable benchmark for evaluating future progress
* Constrain a query to contain less information, making it difficult for agent to navigate.

Future directions:
* NeuAgent observes nodes as it visits during navigation; does not have access to all the nodes for each input query; use for focused crawling as much of content is either hidden or dynamically generated.
